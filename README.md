 # O.I.N.T.S - Open-source Intelligence N' Techical Security
 
 OINTS is a tool that utilizes many api's and small scripts to gather intelligence on a target passively and actively.
 
 
 Much like **recon-ng** but spaghetti code, unstable, built on `sploitkit` and botched :)

## What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for open source intelligence, which refers to any information that can legally be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. 
In practice, that tends to mean information found on the internet, but technically any public information falls into the category of OSINT whether itâ€™s books or reports in a public library, articles in a newspaper or statements in a press release.
