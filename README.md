# O.I.N.T.S - Open-source Intelligence N' Techical Sh**t
 
 OINTS is a tool that utilizes many api's and small scripts to gather intelligence on a target passively and actively.
 
 If you like this project please consider leaving a star :)
 
 Much like **recon-ng** but spaghetti code, unstable, built on `sploitkit` and botched :)

## What is OSINT?

OSINT stands for open source intelligence, which refers to any information that can legally be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. 

In practice, that tends to mean information found on the internet, but technically any public information falls into the category of OSINT whether it’s books or reports in a public library, articles in a newspaper or statements in a press release.

## Installation

The installation of this tool is currently relatively simple however you will need some prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip
- Git
- A brain

To install on linux run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjibrown/OINTS.git
cd OINTS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo mv oints /usr/bin/
```
Now you can simply run `oints` to start well O.I.N.T.S!
